"""
The purpose of this file is to test my understanding of concepts presented in the repo handed down to me from 
previous interns. I will probably use this as a test bed for things before implementing them in their own files.
In the future, I might convert this file into a worksheet of sorts to guide interns taking over.

Task 1: For all 2x2 matrices as outlined in the toy problem, find the Image Product Matrix G and then,
try to find the Embedding Matrix A.
