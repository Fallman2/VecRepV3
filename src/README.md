# Message to new intern 

Hi! This is Andre, the previous intern. I have left as of 2nd Aug.

All the best in continuing the project! Don't worry too much if the project seems overwhelming or if you find it hard to
progress. I was quite lost for a good chunk of the project as well and struggled quite a bit since I was not used to research
work but managed to make some progress in the end. Just try your best and learn as much as you can.

If you need help understanding the project, you can reach out to me.

I have also left a branch called "Incomplete Ideas" which includes a "ConceptTesting.py" file in the data_processing file
that I made to test random snippets of very very unorganised and unoptimised code that may have some ideas that may help
but can be ignored if it's too messy (I didn't have time to clean it up).

Good luck!
Andre
 
# General code overview
## Data processing
All the code that involves calculating image embeddings is here
## Helper functions
Some misc. self contained functions that are used by the code in data processing. 
## Matlab functions
Functions used for pencorr algorithm. Code obtained from Prof SUN Defeng's website here: https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/profile/dfsun/Rank_CaliMatHdm.zip
## Visualization
Code used to evaluate the embeddings generated by data processing. Also code to generate graphs to evalutate the embeddings
## Scripts
Main functions, used to call functions in visualization to generate graphs. Various parameters can be changed here
