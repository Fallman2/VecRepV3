# Message to new intern 

HI THERE THIS IS JED

IF YOU ARE SEEING THIS WE HAVE ALREADY RETIRED ON MARCH 29 

I heard that you are a year 2 math major so this project should be fine for you
however if you feel that you are lost or that you do not know what to do, it is okay

Just make sure that you have fun and enjoy the learning experience.

LOVE AND PEACE

# General code overview
## Data processing
All the code that involves calculating image embeddings is here
## Helper functions
Some misc. self contained functions that are used by the code in data processing. 
## Matlab functions
Functions used for pencorr algorithm. Code obtained from Prof SUN Defeng's website here: https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/profile/dfsun/Rank_CaliMatHdm.zip
## Visualization
Code used to evaluate the embeddings generated by data processing. Also code to generate graphs to evalutate the embeddings
## Scripts
Main functions, used to call functions in visualization to generate graphs. Various parameters can be changed here
