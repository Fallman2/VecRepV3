# General code overview
## Data processing
All the code that involves calculating image embeddings is here
## Helper functions
Some misc. self contained functions that are used by the code in data processing. 
## Matlab functions
Functions used for pencorr algorithm. Code obtained from Prof SUN Defeng's website here: https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/profile/dfsun/Rank_CaliMatHdm.zip
## Visualization
Code used to evaluate the embeddings generated by data processing. Also code to generate graphs to evalutate the embeddings
## Scripts
Main functions, used to call functions in visualization to generate graphs. Various parameters can be changed here
